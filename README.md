# Stage 2

**Statement of Work Updates**

1. Learning specialized manufacturing knowledge:
Based on what we learned about RC vehicles on the video site, we developed a learning plan where each person organized their knowledge based on their assigned topic, which involved acquiring the specialized knowledge needed for the manufacturing process associated with the project, which included the study of materials, processes, machinery, quality control standards, and industry best practices. This is a short-term study, and the aim is not to learn everything in one go; it is a general outline for subsequent studies.

3. Contact manufacturers to make suitable materials:
This was a week-long task that involved communicating with manufacturing partners to produce the materials needed for the project. Since the electrical boards, motors and cameras are all part of the complex electronic components, we chose to go with the finished product, so we manufactured the material content which was the robot's housing, connectors and drives.

4. Holding many team meetings:
During the winter vacation, the team held weekly group meetings. The main content of the meeting was the team members' report on their respective learning outcomes. Since manufacturing circuit boards requires little mechanical knowledge and a long learning cycle, we customized circuit boards on the market according to our needs.

5. Problems identified during the winter vacation and how to solve them:
Due to the robot design of remote sensing system, the current learning content is less desirable and deviates from the mechanical knowledge, so we chose to communicate with the mentor to choose a reasonable solution at the beginning of the semester, which will be greatly conducive to the completion of the group's personal paper in the later stage.

**Design of circuit board**

Circuit learning:

Due to the lack of learning about microcontrollers and PCB circuits during university, it is necessary to expand this part in the future.

Clarify requirements:

Motor drive module, Remote control module, Camera module

✏️Connecting rod mechanism: A small change in the rotation of the motor to a straight line.

✏️Construction of gimbal: The mechanical structure designed for slight adjustments to the camera.

✏️Selection of motors: The deceleration motor meets slight rotation requirements.
